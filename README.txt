Overview: 
This application/program is a text-based clone of the popular Hasbro board game "Connect Four." You can play (locally) with a friend, against yourself or against a very dumb AI. 

To play, you enter the number of the column you wish to drop your piece into, and the piece "falls" until it hits the bottom row, or until it hits any player piece. In order to win the game, you must place at least four of your pieces in a row, diagonally, vertically or horizontally.
